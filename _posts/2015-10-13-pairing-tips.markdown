### "Let's Pair. I'm ready, just give me a second." - Foo ###

  When communicating a time, assume that you will be taken literally.

  Unless, Foo really does start pairing in a second, the other person will naturally assume Foo meant a `minute` instead of a `second`. If the minute has elapsed, then two, then five, it is on Foo to make a new expectation as to when Foo plans to pair. Consider it a break in communication if 5 minutes have elapsed, now the other pair is annoyed, and there is no agreed upon expectation as to when this pairing session is going to happen.

  Time is money and Foo is wasting it by being vague.

### Pairing was scheduled to start 5 minutes ago. Foo has just logged in.

  What should Foo say first?

  Correct.

  "Sorry, I'm late" should be the first thing Foo says. Then, he might follow up with an explanation for his tardiness.

### "Let's revisit this later today." - Foo ###

  What is wrong with these type of time references?

  > 1) They are meaningless to Bar, who is in another time-zone and is already later into his work day.
  > 2) Even if Bar is in the same timezone, these kinds of time references are border-line a disrespect to Bar's day.
  > 3) Since, there really is no time given, it is the worst kind of communicating.

  Respond with something along the lines of: "I need to plan for this, can you give me an 1 hour window that I might expect to pair with you?"
