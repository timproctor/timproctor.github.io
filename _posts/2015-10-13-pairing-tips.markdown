# Pairing Tips (Remote)

### 1. "Let's Pair. I'm ready, just give me a second." - PairFoo ###

  When communicating a time, assume that you will be taken literally.

  Unless, PairFoo really does start pairing in a second, the other person will naturally assume PairFoo meant a `minute` instead of a `second`. If the minute has elapsed, then two, then five, it is on PairFoo to make an new expectation as to when PairFoo plans to pair. Consider it a break in communication if 5 minutes have elapsed, the other pair is annoyed, and there is no agreed upon expectation as to when this pairing session is going to happen.

  Time is money and PairFoo is wasting it by being vague.

### 2. Pairing was scheduled to start 5 minutes ago. PairBar has just logged in.

  What should PairBar say first?

  Correct. "Sorry, I'm late" should be the first thing PairBar says. Then, he might follow up with an explanation for his tardiness.

### 3. "Let's revisit this later today." - PairBar ###

  What is wrong with these type of time references?

  > 1) They are meaningless to PairFoo, who is in another time-zone and is already later into his work day.
  > 2) Even if PairFoo is in the same timezone, these kinds of time references are border-line a disrespect to PairFoo's day.
  > 3) Since, there really is no time given, it is the worst kind of communicating.

  Respond with something along the lines of: "I need to plan for this, can you give me an 1 hour window that I might expect to pair with you?"
