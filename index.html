  <h2 class="post-content">The TL;DR version:</h2>

  <p>After 22 Professional Operas as a chorister, I decided my big break was not coming. Then, I became a middle school teacher. Then, I got married and had some kids. Then, we moved to Colorado. Instead of teaching, I graduated from Turing School of Software and Design. I've been building great software ever since.</p>
